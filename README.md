# NovellaForge
An Open Source Visual Novel Creator In GO

## Mission Statement
NovellaForge aims to democratize the creation of visual novels by providing a game engine that requires zero programming knowledge for building a functional visual novel. However, the framework and editor are fully extensible and modular, allowing full control over the game's source code. For advanced developers with an understanding of GO this flexibility enables the creation of games that go beyond the traditional visual novel genre.
