# Rough initial Roadmap
- [ ] Initial Game Engine (Will have basic functionality)
- [ ] Initial Editor (Will have basic functionality)
- [ ] Open Source the project
- [ ] Create a website for the project
- [ ] Flesh Out this roadmap

Features:

Multi-Platform Support: using Fyne will allow the application to run on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS).

Scene/Menu Templates: These are the different types of scenes or menus that the user can create. You've already identified several types:

Story Variant: This is a scene where the text is the primary focus, and images are secondary. This could be used for narrative-heavy sections of the game.

Puzzle Variant: Similar to the story variant, but with interactive text pieces. This could be used for sections of the game where the player needs to solve a puzzle or make a decision based on the text.

Dialog Variant: This is a scene where images are the primary focus, and the text is secondary. This could be used for sections of the game where the player is having a conversation with a character.

Selector Variant: Similar to the dialog variant, but with multiple choices for the player to select from. This could be used for sections of the game where the player needs to make a decision that will affect the outcome of the story.

Main Menu: This is the first screen that the player sees when they start the game. It should include options to start a new game, load a saved game, adjust settings, and quit the game.

Settings Menu: This is where the player can adjust various settings for the game, such as audio volume, text speed, and display settings.

Save/Load Menu: This is where the player can save their current progress or load a previous save.

Inheritance/Editing: All scene/menu templates should be inheritable and editable, allowing users to customize them to fit their specific needs.

Visual Editor: This is a GUI that allows users to easily create and edit scenes/menus for their game. It should include a variety of tools and options for customizing the appearance and behavior of scenes/menus.

Development Goals:

Usability: The application should be easy to use, even for people with no programming experience. The visual editor should be intuitive and user-friendly.

Flexibility: The application should be flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of visual novel styles and genres. Users should be able to customize nearly every aspect of their game.

Performance: The application should run smoothly and efficiently, even on lower-end hardware.

Reliability: The application should be stable and reliable, with minimal bugs or issues.

Documentation: The application should be well-documented, with clear instructions on how to use each feature.

Community: Encourage a community around the application, where users can share their creations, provide feedback, and help each other.
